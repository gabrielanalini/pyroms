#summary Pyroms is a suite of tools for working with the Regional Ocean Modeling System.

= Introduction =

The tools are based on [http://python.org python], [http://numpy.scipy.org/ numpy] (with the full [http://www.scipy.org scipy] package also recommended), [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net matplotlib] (with the [http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/matplotlib.toolkits.basemap.basemap.html basemap toolkit]), and [http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/ netcdf4-python].  The grid generation is based on the command line utility [http://www.marine.csiro.au/~sakov/  gridgen].  All of these packages should be installed for your best and most fulfilling pyroms experience.

= Obtaining and Installing =

The *pyroms* source code is obtained using the Subversion networked versioning system via the command:

{{{
svn checkout http://pyroms.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pyroms-read-only
}}}

which will download the source code into the subdirectory {{{pyroms-read-only}}}.  You can change the directory name in the {{{svn}}} command to just {{{pyroms}}} or any other arbitrary name you desire.

Once you have downloaded the code, the following commands will compile and install *pyroms* into your local Python library hierarchy.

{{{
cd pyroms-read-only
python setup.py build
su
python setup.py install
}}}

You can now test if it has been properly installed by invoking the Python command-line interpreter:

{{{
python
[...]
>>> import pyroms
}}}

If you get no error messages when you enter {{{import pyroms}}} from within the interpreter, then you have successfully installed *pyroms*.
